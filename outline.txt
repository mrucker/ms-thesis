I would like to use IRL to help people perform better on a continuous control task...

Step 1: Run experiments without any intervention
    
    Data Gathered:
        > Gather performance baselines
        > Gather state trajectory observations for IRL
    
    Questions Answered:
        > Is reward function alone predictive of performance outcomes?
        > Are there clear reward function clusters for high performers?
        > How many clusters of reward functions are there?
    
    Still To Do:
        1. What should the task be?
        2. How do we design the MDP model for IRL?
            > How to discretize the actions?
                > 500 cardinal directions?
                > go to circles on screen?
                > go to a 100x100 grid location on screen
                > left click
                > right click
            > Which features to have in state?
    
Step 2: Design an intervention 
    
    Possible Interventions:
        > Try to modify a person's reward function by modifying task in some way
            > Direct strategic teaching before starting the task ("People who do X, Y and Z tend to perform best")
            > How do we provide real time feedback on reward?
                > "You need to value speed over accuracy more..." Meaningless? Would people know how to do this?
                > 
        > Try to modify a person's action set available to them
            > Does Policy_{r1} + Policy_{r2} == Policy_{r1+r2}?
        > Try to take actions on behalf of the user by inferring their goals
        
        
        Can we assue that the state transition is wellformed? That is, a small action always results in a small change in state?
        IRL Reward might be helpful to understand why some people behave one way over another, but does it make sense to drive interventions?
            > Some people might not be able to carry out certain reward functions
        
Step 3: Run experiments with interventions

An MDP with a policy is a Markov Chain. A Markov Chain can be represented as a Finite State Machine (FSM, aka Finite State Automota).
