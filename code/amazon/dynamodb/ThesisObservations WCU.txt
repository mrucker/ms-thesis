If I round my numbers to whole numbers then each data point will take either 2 or 3 bytes. [1]

This means an individual observation has max size 3 bytes for name (aka, sequenceNumber) + its number count * 3
    i.e. "<sequenceNumber>" : [<list of numbers in observation>]

For a given observation there are 9 numeric data points
    
    Mouse
        1. x
        2. y

    Target
        3. x
        4. y        
        7. age
        8. reward
        -- radius  (maybe store this in ThesisExperiments as well and assume screen size doesn't change?)
        -- opacity (maybe store the rule to calculate this as a field in ThesisExperiments?)
        -- color   (maybe store the rule to calculate this as a field in ThesisExperiments?)
        -- features? (I think this takes up too much data bandwidth for something I can easily re-calculate -- assuming there are no bugs in my code)

So an individual observation in DDB should have a maximum size of

    2*3 + targetCount*4*3 = 66 or so bytes (assuming 5 targets)
    
So a full session then would have a theoretical size of
    
    30 * 900 = 27KB
    
Or if I only do one sequence number for every 30 observations then

    (3 + 9*3*30) * 30 = 25KB <though my observation becomes a list of lists... much less human readable than a map. Does that matter?>
    
So, in theory, and with perfect efficiency, I could record a single experiment, all at once, with 25 WCU. 

If I consider though that an experiment will take place over time I can do even better than 25 WCU. I only need 2 WCU. Consider:
    If I observe at 60HZ and write 30 observations at a time then I will need 2 WCU for an individual person.

If I send 60 at a time...

I could write 30 at a time... which would give me 900 bytes
