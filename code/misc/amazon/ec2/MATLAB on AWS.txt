1. Startup my MATLAB AMI instance as a spot instance (can be done without making a fleet now!)
2. Make sure to turn on RDP permissions for my current ip address
3. SSH into the instance and run `sudo passwd ubuntu` to set the RDP login
4. RDP into the instance
5. navigate to /usr/local/MATLAB/R2019/bin/
6. run the register.sh script (if this doesn't work because of browse issues manually register online and donwload the .lic file)
7. register as the ubuntu user then run `matlab` from the terminal without `root` permissions
