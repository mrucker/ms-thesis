IRL for large state spaces
IRL for human behavior modification

* There's a difference between the person who aces a test after pulling an all-nighter and the person who aces a test without an all-nighter.

ANSWERABLE VIA CURRENT TECHNIQUES
	> Interval Estimation
	> Post-Decision State
	> Basis Function Value Approximation
	> Bias Adjusted Kalman Filter
	> Bootstrapped observations vs un-biased estimates
	> kernel trick for IRL
	> n-step q-learning + w-steps


ANSWERABLE WITH CURRENT EXPERIMENTS

	- How did we modify reward to make it more human interpretable?
		> affine translation
		> less than 0 to 0
		> top 3 percentile to 1 to lowest of top 3 percentile
		> scale to 0->1	
		
	- What is the relationship between the points a person earned and their touch count?

	- How much did participant's ... shift in experiments vs control?
		> reward
		> feature expectation

	- Does it appear that some rewards helped (hurt) certain groups more than others?
		> Based on first experiment touches?
		> Based on first experiment feature expectations?
		
	- Reward doesn't necessarily translate to discovery of new behavior
		> Doesn't seem to help with touch screen???

REQUIRE MORE EXPERIMENTS

	- What is better with people, reward or value? (in theory reward should be invariant to changes in transition probabilities)

	- How do people interpret reward (are they rational?)
		> Loss averse?
		> Logarithmic gain?
		
	- Is it better to think of reward as information or motivation?
		> Would this work better as an intervention in a population that wants to do right but doesn't know how to?
		> Would this work better as an intervention in a population that knows how to do right but doesn't want to?
