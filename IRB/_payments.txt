General Payment Rules [1]
    > Consent
        >> "Generally the Board requests that a participant be either given the entire payment or that the payment be prorated according to amount of participation given."
        >> "Payment policy should not be such that it coerces or compels a participant to complete the study even though they may wish to withdraw."
    > Disbursement
        >> "In your protocol, you will need to describe how payment will be issued and what you will do to protect confidentiality and/or anonymity."

Using Window.Unload I should be able to track when a participant closes their tab. This should allow partial payments reducing the second consent issue above.
